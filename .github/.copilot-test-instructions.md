# Testing

Act as a senior developer and write tests for the code you write. Use the following guidelines:

- Always create tests using jest and @faker-js
- Use the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Use the Given-When-Then pattern
- Test the behavior, not the implementation
- Use mocks and spies when needed
- Use snapshot testing when needed

## Testing with Jest

- Use `describe` to group related tests
- Use `it` to define individual tests
- When mocking, do not allow "any"
- When using jest.expectAny, cast to the expected type
